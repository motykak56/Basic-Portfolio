    <p> I come from Kentucky, graduated from the University of Kentucky with an Engineering Degree.
            Now that I have done that a couple of decades, I seek to make a career change into something 
            a bit more creative (I ended up in maintenance management in my Engineering career and with so much 
            experience at it, that was basically the avenue I was able to sell myself in order to make a living after being 
            out of the job market for a decade caring for my sick parents.  Maintenance management is not the
            creative avenue I seek for myself however.)  So I decided to take the initiative to go after something that would
            make me happy. 
    </p>
   
     
    <p> I loved coding when I was at the University eons ago.  My Computer Science
            Professor said I had a knack for it.  But since my Engineering advisor told me there was no 
            future in it....sure buddy....I remained an Engineering student and graduated that way.  
            With women engineers so in demand and my grades solidly high, I just got swept into it.  And as an
            affirmative action statistic pretty much wherever I went, I was valued for that first.  
            The men figured I got the job because I was female, never figuring it might be
            that I was a top student at University which I was or that I was a top performer on the job
            which was also the case.
    </p>
   
    
    <p>On day one it started that I had to prove I was engineering material because I was a woman.  
            Twenty years later with 2 patents, a wealth of experience and skills and accomplishments to boot, I still 
            had to prove I was engineering material which began to wear me down and out .  All I ever did was seek to prove 
            myself and once I jumped one hurdle there was another one in my path.  Most of them were self-imposed 
            because I have always been one to go for the stars and I was crushing it at work but still it just was 
            not good enough.
    </p>
    
    <p>I have finally come to the conclusion that getting swept up into something is no way to make a career decision.
            It is time to find something a little more satisfying. I want to do something that
            I would continue to do even if I were completely and totally independently wealthy.
            I love coding.  I would continue to do it even if I won the lottery and since I do not play
            the lottery and my chances are about the same of winning whether I play or not...
            I do not expect to win...lol.  But if by chance I did buy that ticket and win, I would still do my coding.  Coding
            is something I can do from home if I so choose, and also something I can end up doing contract.  There
            are so many options once I become experienced, and I plan to be the best at this new endeavor.
